# Langtons_Ant
This repository will contain code I created for running Langton's Ant. In addition to being able to run the original version of Langton's Ant, it is also able to run the completely generalized version of Langton's Ant. See the following two links for more details.

Rules for the generalized Langton's Ant are expressed as a binary number (e.g., the original Langton's Ant is given by Rule 10). In some of the pre-made images, rule numbers have been converted to base 10 for convenience (e.g. The figure Rule3211299.png corresponds to Rule 1100010000000000100011 in binary). As a general rule of thumb, rules that correspond to symmetric binary numbers tend to create interesting images.
